```

This above will add the modules to be acccessible to your xmonad.hs

You then need to add the follow imports (and problaby more - have a look at my xmonad.hs):

    import           MiddleColumn
    import WindowColumn
    import WindowColumn as Column (Column(..))
    import XMonad.Actions.Submap

This helper function:

    defaultThreeColumn :: (Float, Float, Float)
    defaultThreeColumn = (0.15, 0.65, 0.2)

Add the layout to your config (by adding it within `layoutHook`), for example:

    layoutHook = (desktopLayoutModifiers $ getMiddleColumnSaneDefault 2 0.15 defaultThreeColumn)

Now you just need to set the keybindings. I'm using a dvorak layout keyboard so these perhaps could be set to something else, but I've attached my entire xmonad.hs in this repo.


## Functionality:
- Main rectangle that is centered.
- Additional rows can be added in the middle column.
- Set a specific ratio between rows in the middle column can be set when there are two or three windows in the middle column.
- Pin the left or right to have a maximum amount windows. (I usuall have two left pinned windows). So for example you can pin the left column to only have a maximum of two windows, of which additional windows would accumulate on the right column.
- Swop the left or right column with the middle column.
- Swop or focus a window in the left or right column by the position in the column. For example you can focus the 3rd Window in the left column.
- Set the left or right column width individually.
